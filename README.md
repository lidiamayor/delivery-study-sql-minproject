# üöö Delivery Data Analysis Project

**Authors**: [Ana Nofuentes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/ana-nofuentes-solano-654026a3/) & [Lidia Mayor](https://www.linkedin.com/in/lidia-mayor-sanjuan-3b350930b/)

## üìã Project Overview

This project is a data analysis of a delivery company where we worked with SQL and Python to explore and visualize the data. Our aim was to understand key business metrics and identify trends to help improve the company‚Äôs operations.

### üîß Tools Used:
- **SQL**: For database management, schema creation, and querying.
- **Python**: For data manipulation, importing from Kaggle, and visualization.
- [**Kaggle Dataset**](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kapturovalexander/karpovs-sql-simulator?resource=download&select=orders.csv): The delivery data was sourced from a public Kaggle database.
- **Canva**: For presenting our findings in a clear and visually appealing format.


## üõ†Ô∏è Project Workflow:

1. **Database Design**  
   We started by designing the **data schema** for the delivery company using SQL. A diagram was created to represent the relationships between tables and define the database structure.

2. **Data Import**  
   We imported the delivery dataset from Kaggle using Python and then uploaded the data into SQL for further analysis.

3. **Table Creation**  
   In SQL, we created the necessary tables based on the imported data and the schema. This allowed us to organize and structure the data efficiently.

4. **Data Analysis in Python**  
   Once the data was structured, we ran SQL queries from Python to extract insights and visualize the data with libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. These visualizations helped us analyze metrics such as delivery times, customer satisfaction, and order volumes.

## üì∏ Key Visual Insights

Here are some key insights visualized from our analysis:

### 1. SQL Database Schema

   *A clear representation of the relationships between tables in the delivery database.*

### 2. Cancellation Frequency Analysis
   ![Cancellation Frequency](https://github.com/lidiamayor/delivery-study-sql-minproject/blob/main/images/cancellation.png)  
   *This chart shows the frequency at which orders are canceled depending on the time elapsed after placing the order.*

### 3. Orders by Hour and Day of the Week
   ![Orders by Hour and Day](https://github.com/lidiamayor/delivery-study-sql-minproject/blob/main/images/orders.png)  
   *A heatmap displaying the distribution of orders by hour and day of the week, helping to identify peak times.*


## üñºÔ∏è Storytelling Presentation

We compiled our findings into a presentation, highlighting the key insights and actionable conclusions. You can view our final presentation here:
